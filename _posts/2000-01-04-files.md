# Working with files

- Where am I?

`$ pwd`

- Changing directories

`$ cd path/to/directory`

- Moving things around 

`$ mv -v <filename> /another/path/`

- Deleting things FOREVER

`sudo mv -v <filename> /dev/null/`

- Copying stuff

`$ cp -v <filename> <another-filename>`

- Deleting files

`$ rm -v <filename>`

- Deleting folders

`$ rm -vR /path/to/<folder>`

- Updating timestamp:

`$ touch <filename>`

- Listing files and directories

`$ ls -al`

Notes: 
- `-a` tells ls to list all files.
- Files starting with `.` are hidden files. (Remember this).

- Printing the content of a file:

`cat <filename.txt>`

- Printing the last 2 lines of a file:

`tail -n 2 <filename.txt>`

- Printing the first 2 lines of a file:

`head -n 2 <filename.txt>`
