# Hey you!

This is a "go through" guide intended to help newcomers and medium Linux users on consulting useful bash commands.

This is a living web page! Which means it will be updated on a regular basis as more and more people contribute to it :)

This is not a guide, nor a tutorial for Linux, Shell or Bash. For reals. It's just a collection of some good commands, materials, tips and tricks gathered from all around the internet and presented in a nice way so you can easily find it.

Thank you and keep bashing!
