# Tailing

### Search, save and simplify command outputs:

Bit bucket (as known as the black hole, one of the linux's special files):

`/dev/null`

Standard input stream:

`STDIN`

Standard outpout streams:

`STDERR` and `STDOUT`

Tailing files (getting the last lines)

`$ tail <file>`

Outputing whole file content

`$ cat <file>`

Reading from `STDIN` to a file (stop with `CTRL + C`)

`cat > <file>`

Reading from file to another file

`cat <file1> > <file2>`

Reading all lines of file with line numbers

`cat -n <file>`

Saving output to file (using nano editor)

`$ <command> | nano file_name`

Searching through the output

`$ <command> | grep <term>`

Displaying output in a file-like style (`less` allows searching by pressing `/`)

`$ <command>|less` or `$ <command>|more`

Preventing terminal hanging (command outputs will still be shown in the terminal)

`$ <command>& `

Ignoring file output completely (note that `2 = STDERR` and `1 = STDOUT`)

`$ <command> > /dev/null 2 > &1`
