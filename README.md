## Why?

GNU/Linux, at first sight, seems like a really scary platform for most

collection of boilerplate shell commands presented in a nice and
organized way aimed to help people lose their fear and start using
this awesome Operational System!

functional languages, solving problems, DevOps culture and
obviously...Linux!
